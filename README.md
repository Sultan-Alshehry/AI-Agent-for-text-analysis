# AI Agent for Text Analysis

A Bachelor's Project course project.

## Project Description

- **AITY –AI Agent for text analysing.** AITY is a concept or project of automatic text analysis created by Dorina Rajanen. AITY builds
    on the ability of an AI agent that analyses a text document (research article or new article) and identifies keywords, themes,
    topics. AITY then extracts these categories and stores them in a database. AITY also compares different documents and
    creates different analyses on the documents.
- Course project assignment includes the following tasks (selection of these can be discussed with the team):
    - Design, prototype and implement an AI agent for text analysis together with the documentation and literature review
    - Choose the AI platform suitable for the task and document the choice made
    - Document the ethical aspects of using research articles or news articles by the AI agent based on literature and available sources of the
       articles (e.g., news sites or scholarly databases or forums)
    - Document and calculate sustainability indicators such as carbon footprint for each document analysed
    - Design and implement a simple user interface of the agent
    - Document implementation options local versus public agent
    - Experimental results on a given dataset
